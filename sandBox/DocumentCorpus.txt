VCoke takes heat for 'sexist' pin-up ads 'Drink what she's wearing,' reads one advertisement for milk product\u000a\u000aSex sells, but did Coke go too far in its new ads for a new line of premium milk?\u000a\u000aThe soft drink maker is trying its hand in the dairy industry with Fairlife, a milk product with 50 percent more calcium and protein than regular milk.\u000a\u000aIn a line of ads for Fairlife, Coke used pin-up girls that are (literally) wearing the product.\u000a\u000a"Better milk looks good on you," says another.\u000a\u000aThe photos are from a series shot in 2013 by photographer Jaroslav Wieczorkiewicz. While many are praising the actual art, the ads have sparked a dialog about using women's bodies in advertising.\u000a\u000a"This is just the latest in a never-ending stream of examples of women\u2019s bodies used as advertising fodder with scant regard for relevance or originality," Laura Bates wrote in the Guardian.

aVIt's that time of year again.\u000a\u000aSanta is making his list and checking it twice. And Google too is getting in on the list action.\u000a\u000aThe Internet giant has compiled the most searched for, or top trending, toys in November.\u000a\u000aIt's a pretty good measure of what parents will be buying, er, I mean what Santa will be hauling down the chimney this year.\u000a\u000aHere's the list starting with the most popular:\u000a\u000aShe's 18 inches tall and she's the most popular toy on the Internet. Mattel's American Girl line of dolls and accessories was the most searched for toy last month. Google does not specify which American Girl -- Addy, Caroline, Josefina -- got the most clicks. But Isabelle Palmer is this year's Girl of the Year. She's an "inspired dancer" with "sparkling hazel eyes" and she will set you back $120 or $134 if she has pierced ears.\u000a\u000aPrincess Twilight Sparkle and her magical pony pals are hot this year. The My Little Pony toys were the second most searched last month. They cost anywhere from $4.99 for a single figure to $39.99 for a full play set.\u000a\u000aThe rescue pups on Paw Patrol from the Canadian TV series has been a hit on Nickelodeon since 2013. The top-selling Paw Patrol Look-out play set retails for $39.99.\u000a\u000aThe line of Lego toys aimed at girls 5 and up have taken off. Lego unveiled Lego Friends in 2011 in response to criticism that it didn't have enough "girl" toys. The top seller is the Lego Friends Heartlake Shopping Mall play set, which costs about $100.\u000a\u000aChristmas isn't supposed to be spooky. But don't tell that to all the people searching for Ouija Boards online. The sudden interest in the board game/psychic medium stems from the October 24 release of "Ouija," a low-budget horror movie that was popular with teens. The standard, non-glow-in-the-dark Ouija Board, can be had for $19.99.\u000a\u000aIt wouldn't be a proper Christmas without Peppa Pig. The British cartoon aimed at preschoolers has been around for about 10 years. Peppa Pig toys include stuffed animals, books and figures, ranging in price from less than $10 to more than $40.\u000a\u000aIt's never too soon to start learning about shopping. The Shopkins toys are popular with kids five and up. The basic Shopkins supermarket play set, complete with merry-go-round checkout counter, sells for $24.99.\u000a\u000aThe Nerf arms race is on. Kids ages eight and up can arm themselves with bristling array of Nerf weaponry. The Nerf N-Strike Elite Retaliator Blaster ($23.99) fires "elite darts" made of foam up to 75 feet.\u000a\u000aBarbie can live large in a new dream house for about $150. It's a three-story Malibu townhouse play set complete with an elevator, fireplace, hot tub and "luxe stainless steel appliances" in the kitchen. The 30-inch high dream house is for ages three and up.\u000a\u000aThe Zoomer Dino is a battery operated interactive toy for ages five and up. It rolls on two wheels, gets angry or excited depending on how you treat it, and makes sounds that include farts and burps, all for a little under $80.

aVClark-O'Neal Funeral Home on Lincolnway West was served a temporary restraining order by the Attorney General's Office Tuesday morning after the Department of Revenue alleges the funeral home did not pay $258,329.25 in taxes, according to court documents.\u000a\u000aThe Department alleges the business did not pay their taxes from December 1, 2002 through January 31, 2014.\u000a\u000aThe owner, Julius O'Neal, did not agree to an on-camera interview.\u000a\u000aO'Neal did say the $258,000 sum was just an estimate that spans back many years. O'Neal went on to say that his attorney will be working to get the issue resolved in the coming days.\u000a\u000aO'Neal's attorney did file a motion to set aside the order.\u000a\u000aIn the meantime, the funeral home will honor their already scheduled services. As of Tuesday evening, the Clark-O'Neal website indicates there are three funerals this week and one pending service.\u000a\u000aHowever, the court documents indicate the funeral home does not have a license to operate in the state of Indiana.\u000a\u000aThe documents allege the certificate to operate expired in April 2013; meaning the funeral home has been operating without the proper license for more than one year.\u000a\u000aIt's unclear if the funeral home has been collecting taxes during that time.\u000a\u000aThe Department only needs 1 tax warrant to seek an injunction, but there were 188 tax warrants from December 1, 2002 through January 31, 2014.\u000a\u000aNext week, the judge will decide if the business will be reopened or permanently closed. The Attorney General's Office is asking O'Neal to compile a current list of the names of the deceased and dates of services moving forward. That list must be turned into the office by 12PM on December 3rd.
