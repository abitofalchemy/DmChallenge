Classification
In this assignment, we tried the following classification methods:
- Support Vector Machines
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest

For validation purposes, we chose 10 fold cross validation. We performed stratified sampling while performing cross validation because the dataset is imbalanced.

On observing the performance of different classifiers on the dataset, we saw that random forest performs the best.
Therefore, we propose the use of random forest for this dataset
