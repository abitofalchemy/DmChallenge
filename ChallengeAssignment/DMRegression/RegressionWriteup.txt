Regression
In this assignment, we tried the following regression methods:
- Linear regression
- Logistic regression


For validation purposes, we chose 10 fold cross validation. We performed stratified sampling while performing cross validation because the data is clustered and unbalanced

The performance, although slow, the logistic regression was most appropriate.
